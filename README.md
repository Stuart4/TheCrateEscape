#Tips
- If you have tearing problems, run in windowed mode.
- There is a good script for object pooling in [Assets/Scripts/](https://github.com/Stuart4/TheCrateEscape/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Spawner.cs).
- There is an awesome character movement script in [Assets/Scripts/](https://github.com/Stuart4/TheCrateEscape/blob/master/Assets/Scripts/Character.cs) that provides ground checking, jumping, jump delaying, and L/R movement.
